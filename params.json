  "body": "### Web-framework for Ruby.\r\nWeb framework, wich uses a lot of Ruby magic to achive nice balance between code readability, productivity of developer and speed of execution (but speed of execution is least important) \r\n\r\n### How to use it?\r\nExtend your controller with Dhh::Controller. And you will get the route called https://base_url/controller_name/action_name\r\n\r\n`class HelloController < Dhh::Controller`\r\n  `# this will be https://base_url/hello/index`\r\n  `def index`\r\n    `render :index, noun: :unicorn`\r\n  `end`\r\n\r\n  `# dump_controller which show rack content`\r\n  `def env_info`\r\n    `ar = env.to_s.split(',')`\r\n    `output = ''`\r\n    `ar.each do |line|`\r\n      `output += \"#{line.to_s}\" + \"<br>\"`\r\n    `end`\r\n    `output`\r\n  `end`\r\n`end`\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributorâ€™s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n",
