To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.\r\n\r\nTODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'dhh'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install dhh\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTODO: Write usage instructions here\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\r\n\r\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/dhh.\r\n\r\n",
