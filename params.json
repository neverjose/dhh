  "body": "# Dhh\r\n\r\nWelcome to Dhh project! This web framework created as easy to use and small clone of rails, which is working on top of Rack.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'dhh'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install dhh\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nControllers:\r\n\r\nExtend your controller with Dhh::Controller. And you will get the route called https://base_url/controller_name/action_name\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass HelloController < Dhh::Controller\r\n  # this will be https://base_url/hello/index\r\n  def index\r\n    render :index, noun: :unicorn\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  # dump_controller which show rack content\r\n  def env_info\r\n    ar = env.to_s.split(',')\r\n    output = ''\r\n    ar.each do |line|\r\n      output += \"#{line.to_s}\" + \"<br>\"\r\n    end\r\n    output\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nViews:\r\n\r\nTo create a view you should follow next rules:\r\n\r\n1. In app/views folder create folder with controller name, e.g. HelloController's view folder should have a name app/views/hello/.\r\n2. To bind view to an an action use render method.\r\n\r\nController:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/controllers/hello_controller.rb\r\nclass HelloController < Dhh::Controller\r\n  def index\r\n    render :index, noun: :unicorn\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nView:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n# app/views/hello/index.html.erb\r\n<h1>This is my <%= unicorn %></h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\r\n\r\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/raventid/dhh.\r\n\r\n",
